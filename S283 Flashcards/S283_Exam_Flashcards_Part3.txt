What determines whether a gas molecule can escape a planet's atmosphere?	Atmospheric escape depends on: 1) The planet's escape velocity ($v_{esc} = \sqrt{2GM/R}$); 2) The gas molecule's average thermal velocity ($v_{thermal} \propto \sqrt{T/m}$ where T is temperature and m is molecular mass); 3) When thermal velocity approaches escape velocity, significant escape occurs; 4) Lighter molecules (H2, He) escape more easily than heavier ones (CO2, N2). This explains why Earth retained N2 but lost most H2 and He.
Describe the vertical structure of Earth's atmosphere and how temperature varies with altitude.	Earth's atmosphere has these layers:
• Troposphere: Temperature decreases with height; weather occurs here
• Stratosphere: Temperature increases with height due to ozone absorption
• Mesosphere: Temperature decreases with height
• Thermosphere: Temperature increases with height due to UV absorption
• Exosphere: Outermost layer transitioning to space
What factors affect global temperatures on terrestrial planets with atmospheres?	Factors include: 1) Distance from the Sun; 2) Albedo (reflectivity); 3) Atmospheric composition, especially greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4, H2O; 4) Atmospheric pressure and density; 5) Orbital parameters (eccentricity, obliquity); 6) Surface properties; 7) Internal heat (significant for young planets).
What is the greenhouse effect and how does it work?	The greenhouse effect is the warming of a planet's surface and lower atmosphere due to certain gases that trap heat. It works because: 1) Visible and UV radiation from the sun passes through the atmosphere and warms the surface; 2) The warm surface emits infrared radiation; 3) Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, H2O, etc.) absorb this IR radiation; 4) The gases re-emit the IR in all directions, sending some back toward the surface; 5) This trapped energy raises the temperature higher than it would be without the atmospheric effect. Without this natural process, Earth would be about 33°C colder.
What causes the different colors and bands in Jupiter's atmosphere?	Jupiter's colored bands result from: 1) Upwelling and downwelling in the atmospheric circulation (light-colored zones are upwelling ammonia clouds, dark belts are downwelling regions); 2) Different cloud compositions at different altitudes (ammonia ice is highest/white, ammonium hydrosulfide is middle/tan, water is lowest/red-brown); 3) Photochemical reactions creating colored compounds, particularly phosphorus, sulfur, and organic compounds that appear reddish-brown; 4) The counterrotating jet streams that create the distinct boundaries between bands; 5) Large-scale convection cells driven by internal heat and rapid rotation.
How does Titan's atmosphere compare to Earth's?	Similarities: 1) Similar pressure (1.5 times Earth's); 2) Nitrogen-dominated (95% on Titan, 78% on Earth); 3) Complex organic chemistry; 4) Weather systems with precipitation and surface liquids; 5) Troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere layers.
Differences: 1) Much colder (94K vs 288K); 2) Methane plays role of water (2% vs Earth's water vapor ~1%); 3) No oxygen; 4) Thick hydrocarbon haze; 5) Much higher atmosphere (1200km vs 100km due to lower gravity); 6) Liquid methane/ethane cycle instead of water cycle.
What is atmospheric escape and what are the main mechanisms?	Atmospheric escape is the process by which planetary atmospheres lose gas to space. The main mechanisms are:
1) Thermal (Jeans) escape: Molecules in the high-velocity tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution exceed escape velocity
2) Hydrodynamic escape: Entire upper atmosphere flows outward (important in early solar system and hot Jupiters)
3) Photochemical escape: UV photons break molecular bonds, creating energetic fragments that escape
4) Impact erosion: Large impacts eject atmospheric gases
5) Ion pickup: Solar wind ions transfer momentum to ionized atmospheric particles
6) Sputtering: Energetic particles knock atmospheric molecules into space
The dominant mechanisms depend on planetary mass, magnetic field strength, and atmospheric composition.
What causes super-rotation in planetary atmospheres like Venus and Titan?	Super-rotation occurs when an atmosphere rotates faster than the planet's surface. On Venus, the atmosphere circles the planet in just 4 Earth days while the planet itself rotates once every 243 Earth days. Causes include: 1) Thermal tides (solar heating creates a day-night pressure difference); 2) Meridional (equator-to-pole) circulation transferring angular momentum toward equator; 3) Barotropic instabilities in the mid-latitudes; 4) Lack of surface friction due to slow planetary rotation; 5) Hadley cells extending to high latitudes. Similar processes occur on Titan, though with different timescales.
What are the major differences between the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars?	Venus: 96% CO2, 92 bar pressure, 737K surface temperature, sulfuric acid clouds, no water, super-rotation
Earth: 78% N2, 21% O2, 1 bar pressure, 288K average surface temperature, water clouds and precipitation, ozone layer
Mars: 95% CO2, 0.006 bar pressure, 210K average surface temperature, seasonal CO2 ice caps, dust storms, no magnetic field protection

The differences result from: 1) Distance from Sun; 2) Planetary mass affecting gas retention; 3) Runaway greenhouse effect on Venus; 4) Biological oxygen production on Earth; 5) Loss of Mars' early atmosphere due to solar wind interaction after its magnetic field collapsed.
What evidence suggests Mars had liquid water on its surface in the past?	Evidence includes: 1) Dendritic valley networks resembling river systems; 2) Outflow channels suggesting catastrophic floods; 3) Deltas and alluvial fans indicating deposition in standing water; 4) Layered sedimentary rocks with minerals requiring water formation; 5) Hematite concretions ("blueberries") formed in aqueous environments; 6) Clay minerals requiring long-term water interaction.
Compare the crustal resurfacing mechanisms on Earth and Europa.	Earth: Plate tectonics with seafloor spreading creating new crust and subduction destroying old crust. Driven by mantle convection.
Europa: Crustal recycling through processes like diapirism (warm ice rising), double ridges forming from repeated fracturing, chaos regions where ice blocks have been disrupted and rotated. Driven by tidal heating and possibly connection to subsurface ocean.
Describe the Martian geologic history divided into Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian epochs.	• Noachian (4.1-3.7 Ga): Heavy bombardment, extensive valley networks, clay formation, wetter and possibly warmer climate, thicker atmosphere
• Hesperian (3.7-3.0 Ga): Declining water activity, transition to acidic conditions, widespread volcanism, formation of outflow channels, sulfate deposition
• Amazonian (3.0 Ga-present): Cold and dry conditions, minimal water activity, polar ice cap variations, low erosion rates, occasional glacial and periglacial processes
How are impact craters used to determine the relative age of planetary surfaces?	Impact craters accumulate over time, so more heavily cratered surfaces are generally older. Relative dating uses: 1) Crater counting (number of craters per unit area); 2) Size-frequency distribution (larger craters are rarer but accumulate on older surfaces); 3) Crater overlap and superposition relationships; 4) Crater degradation state; 5) Correlation with radiometrically dated lunar samples to calibrate absolute ages.
What processes form the different types of volcanic features on terrestrial bodies?	Shield volcanoes (e.g., Olympus Mons): Form from low-viscosity basaltic lava that spreads far before cooling, creating broad, gently sloped edifices.
Stratovolcanoes (e.g., Mauna Kea): Form from alternating explosive and effusive eruptions, creating steeper, layered cones.
Pyroclastic deposits: Form from explosive eruptions ejecting ash, pumice, and other fragmental material.
Calderas: Form when magma chamber empties and the volcano collapses inward.
Fissure eruptions: Form from eruptions along linear cracks, creating vast lava plains.
The controlling factors include: magma composition, gas content, eruption temperature, planetary gravity, atmospheric pressure, and tectonic setting.
What evidence indicates past volcanic activity on Venus?	Evidence includes: 1) Over 1,000 shield volcanoes identified in radar images; 2) Extensive lava plains covering 80% of the surface; 3) Pancake domes formed by eruption of viscous lava; 4) Canali (long, sinuous channels) formed by very fluid lava flows; 5) Corona structures formed by upwelling mantle plumes; 6) Volcanic features with few impact craters, suggesting geologically recent formation; 7) Possible active volcanism indicated by variations in atmospheric SO2 and thermal anomalies detected by Venus Express.
How do fluvial features on Mars compare to those on Earth?	Similarities: 1) Dendritic valley networks resembling terrestrial river systems; 2) Channels with tributary systems; 3) Deltas where flows entered standing bodies of water; 4) Streamlined islands and erosional features in outflow channels; 5) Evidence of meandering and braided channels.

Differences: 1) Most Martian fluvial features are ancient (>3 billion years old) while Earth's are active or geologically recent; 2) Martian outflow channels suggest catastrophic flood events rather than steady flow; 3) Martian channels are generally larger in scale; 4) No current surface water flow on Mars due to atmospheric conditions; 5) Different weathering chemistry due to Martian surface composition and temperature regime.
What is the crustal dichotomy on Mars and what are the proposed explanations for it?	The crustal dichotomy refers to the stark difference between Mars' northern and southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere is characterized by low-lying plains (2-3 km below datum) with thin crust (25-35 km), while the southern hemisphere consists of heavily cratered highlands with thick crust (50-80 km).

Proposed explanations include: 1) One or more giant impacts in the northern hemisphere; 2) Internal convection patterns in the early Martian mantle causing asymmetric crustal formation; 3) Degree-1 mantle convection (single upwelling/downwelling system); 4) Early plate tectonic processes that subsequently ceased; 5) Some combination of these processes. The dichotomy is one of the oldest features on Mars, dating to at least 4.1 billion years ago.
What evidence suggests cryovolcanism on icy bodies in the outer solar system?	Evidence for cryovolcanism includes: 1) Smooth plains with flow-like features on bodies like Enceladus, Triton, and Pluto; 2) Active plumes of water vapor and ice particles observed erupting from Enceladus's south polar region; 3) Nitrogen geysers on Triton; 4) Young surface ages indicating recent resurfacing; 5) Surface deposits of ammonia hydrates and other materials that could act as antifreeze compounds in subsurface reservoirs; 6) Wright Mons and other possible cryovolcanic constructs on Pluto; 7) Dome-like structures on Europa that may represent intrusions of warm ice.
