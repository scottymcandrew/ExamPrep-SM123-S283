What is the IAU definition of a planet and why was Pluto reclassified?	According to the IAU definition, a planet must: 1) orbit the Sun, 2) have sufficient mass for self-gravity to make it round, and 3) have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto was reclassified because it fails the third criterion - its orbit crosses that of bodies with similar and larger mass.
What are the characteristics of (1) Ceres that confirm it to be a dwarf planet?	Ceres: 1) orbits the Sun directly, 2) has sufficient gravity to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium (round shape), 3) has not cleared its orbital neighborhood, and 4) is not a satellite of another body.
What are the main differences between Classical Kuiper Belt objects, Plutinos, and Scattered Disc objects?	• Classical Kuiper Belt objects: Orbit beyond Neptune with low eccentricity, semimajor axes typically 42-48 AU
• Plutinos: In 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune (orbit the Sun 2 times for every 3 Neptune orbits), semimajor axes around 39.4 AU
• Scattered Disc objects: High eccentricity orbits, often extending far beyond the Kuiper Belt, with perihelion distances near Neptune's orbit, generally with a > 30 AU
Compare and contrast Pluto and Triton in terms of location, orbit, physical properties, and origin.	Location/orbit: Pluto is a dwarf planet with a 248-year eccentric orbit crossing Neptune's; Triton is Neptune's largest moon with a retrograde orbit.
Physical properties: Both are similar in size (Pluto ~2370 km, Triton ~2700 km), density (~1.8-2.1 g/cm³), and composition (nitrogen, methane, and water ices).
Origin: Pluto formed in the outer solar system; Triton is likely a captured Kuiper Belt Object due to its retrograde orbit.
Both show evidence of geological activity and seasonal volatile transport.
What is the approximate distance of Neptune from the Sun?	Neptune orbits at approximately 30 AU from the Sun.
What is the approximate mass of Neptune?	Neptune's mass is approximately 17 Earth masses (1.02 × 10^26 kg).
What are the four Galilean moons of Jupiter in order from innermost to outermost?	Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
What are the key characteristics of Io?	Io is the innermost Galilean moon of Jupiter, with extreme volcanic activity (most active in solar system), sulfur dioxide surface, lack of impact craters due to rapid resurfacing, yellow-orange appearance due to sulfur compounds, and strong tidal heating from Jupiter's gravitational influence.
What are the key characteristics of Europa?	Europa features a young, icy surface crossed by linear features ("ball-of-string" ridges), very few impact craters, a subsurface global liquid water ocean, an induced magnetic field from Jupiter's magnetosphere interacting with its salty ocean, and possible plumes of water vapor erupting from the surface.
What are the key characteristics of Ganymede?	Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (larger than Mercury), has both dark ancient terrain and grooved, lighter terrain, possesses its own internally generated magnetic field (unique among moons), likely contains a subsurface ocean, and shows evidence of past tectonic activity.
What are the key characteristics of Callisto?	Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered surface (most heavily cratered in the Jupiter system), shows little evidence of internal geological activity, lacks significant tidal heating due to being furthest from Jupiter, may contain a subsurface ocean, and has a surface dominated by water ice and rocky materials.
What is the magnetosphere and how does it form?	The magnetosphere is a region around a planet where its magnetic field dominates over the solar wind. It forms when a planet has an internal magnetic field (usually generated by a liquid, conducting core with convective motion) that deflects charged particles from the solar wind. The magnetosphere creates a protective bubble, shielding the planet from solar radiation.
What are the main parts of a planetary magnetosphere?	The main parts include: 1) Bow shock - where the solar wind first slows from supersonic to subsonic speeds; 2) Magnetosheath - turbulent region between bow shock and magnetopause; 3) Magnetopause - boundary where planetary magnetic pressure balances solar wind pressure; 4) Magnetotail - elongated region on the night side; 5) Radiation belts (like Van Allen belts) - regions where charged particles become trapped in magnetic field lines.
Which terrestrial planets have active magnetic fields and why?	Earth and Mercury have active global magnetic fields, while Mars and Venus do not. Earth's field is generated by its liquid outer core of iron and nickel undergoing convection and rotation (dynamo effect). Mercury has a weak field from its large, partially liquid iron core. Mars has only localized crustal fields from past magnetism. Venus lacks a field due to its slow rotation and possibly solid core.
What evidence suggests Ganymede has an internal ocean?	Evidence includes: 1) Induced magnetic signature detected by Galileo spacecraft; 2) Changes in Ganymede's aurora patterns as it moves through Jupiter's magnetic field; 3) Surface features suggesting past tectonic activity possibly driven by tidal heating; 4) Models of internal heat distribution suggesting a layer between its icy crust and rocky mantle.
What evidence suggests Europa has an internal ocean?	Evidence includes: 1) Induced magnetic field detected by Galileo suggesting a conducting, salty liquid layer; 2) Young surface age indicating active resurfacing; 3) Chaotic terrain suggesting interaction between surface and subsurface; 4) ridges and cracks consistent with tidal flexing of ice above liquid; 5) Color deposits along fractures suggesting upwelling of oceanic material; 6) Hubble observations of possible water vapor plumes.
What are the main types of asteroids based on spectral classification?	The main types are:
• C-type: Carbon-rich, dark, most common (~75% of known asteroids)
• S-type: Silicaceous (stony), moderate albedo (~17% of known asteroids)
• M-type: Metallic, moderately bright
• D-type: Very red, found in outer asteroid belt and beyond
• V-type: Associated with Vesta, basaltic composition
• E-type: High albedo, enstatite-rich composition
Where is the asteroid belt located and what are its boundaries?	The main asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter, approximately 2.2 to 3.2 AU from the Sun. Its inner boundary is defined by the 4:1 resonance with Jupiter (about 2.06 AU), and its outer boundary is near the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter (about 3.28 AU).
How do you calculate orbital eccentricity using perihelion and aphelion distances?	Orbital eccentricity (e) can be calculated using:
e = (Q - q)/(Q + q)
where Q is the aphelion distance and q is the perihelion distance.
Given a semimajor axis (a) and eccentricity (e), how do you calculate perihelion (q) and aphelion (Q) distances?	Perihelion distance: q = a(1-e)
Aphelion distance: Q = a(1+e)
